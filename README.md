# TwitterMiningWebAppInterface
This project is a summer'12 project advanced by the [Quantitative Analysis Center](http://qac.blogs.wesleyan.edu/) at Wesleyan University.

    The project aimed to develop a tool that would track specific terminology on Twitter. The data generated from
the Twitter Mining Project was intended for use by the Political Science Department. My role in this project was 
to create a web application that would allow users to adjust their preferable tracking parameters. The first 
beta version of this web application is now available [here](http://qacprojects.wesleyan.edu/interface/).
